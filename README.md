# Microchip PIC Serial Programmer (MPSP)
The MPSP is a Microchip PICÂ© microcontroller Programmer, connected to PC via Serial (RS232) Port. In addition, it allows reading and writing of serial EEPROM memories.

It is based on the [JDM-2 programmer, created by Jens Dyekjaer Madsen](https://web.archive.org/web/20141023232906/http://www.jdm.homepage.dk/newpic.htm), and contains the changes proposed by [BT Kelly in the JDM-B programmer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203162849/http:/users.tpg.com.au/btkelly/jdm_b.htm), in addition to other characteristics of its own.
